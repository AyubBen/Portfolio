## Questions to answer:
### 1- Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?

The product category that drives the biggest profits is Toys with 1.08 million which consists of teddy bears, lego bricks, hot wheels, and more, followed by:

2- Electronic with 1 million. (Products  such as Toy Robot, Gamer Headphones, and Colorbuds)
3- Arts & Crafts with 750K. (Products such as Play Foam, Playdoh, and Magic Sand)
4- Games with 670K. (Products such as Board and Card Games)
5- Sports and Outdoors with 510K. (Products such as Water Gun, Nerf Gun,s and Basketball Hoops)

Let's Dive deeper into each location, and find if the store location attracts different customers and produces different product category results than each other.

The Commercial store location had Electronics as its most profitable product category, although toys came in second by a small number. Meanwhile, the rest of the locations which had Toys as their highest profitable category.  An interesting observation is that Sports and Outdoors are the least profitable category even though the sales are somewhat close to the Electronics and Games categories. This is due to the high cost of making these products.



### 2- Can you find any seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data?

- A pattern that was found is that each weekend the total sales reach their highest point (Saturday/Sunday), while the lowest point is during weekdays (Wednesday/Thursday). With an average decrease of 35-40% from weekends to weekdays.
 The factors associated with this finding could be due to parents or people being busy during the week to spend time shopping. Then, when the weekend arrives, they have free time to go out and purchase toys. Discounts and promotions are also generally popular to be on weekends.


- The first possible seasonality is that the 30th of April and the 24th of Christmas have the highest total sales per day per year. This is due to the first date being Children's Day in Mexico, and Christmas for the second date. 

- The second possible seasonality is that by the end of August and early September, the total sales per day are at their lowest point throughout the year. This perhaps is possible due to the end of summer, and the beginning of the new school year. Parents would be prioritizing their spending on school equipment.

The reason I said it's "possible" for both seasonalities is that the data provided is for a year and approximately 10 months, and more data is needed to confirm this seasonality for the upcoming years.


### 3- Are sales being lost with out-of-stock products at certain locations?

There are sales being lost due to out-of-stock products at all locations, but some more than others. The total sales lost is $966. Downtown lost the most amount of sales which is approximately $565, while the residential and commercial store locations lost $205 and $170 respectively. Lastly, airport store locations had the least amount of losses which was $27.


### 4- How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores?**

The total amount of money tied up in the toy store's inventory is 300K, and a total amount of 30K units. This is respectively split to:

- Arts & Crafts, 65K, and 8.6K.
- Toys, 100K, and 7.6K.
- Games, 51K, 6.2K.
- Sports & Outdoors, 53K, and 5K.
- Electronics, 31K, and 2.4K.

The End.
